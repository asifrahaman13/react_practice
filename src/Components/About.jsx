                        Overclocking the monitor means changing the stock refresh rate (say from 60Hz monitor to 70 Hz) to get better frame rates and hence experience more smoothness on the device output.<br/><br/>
                            Frame rate is the number of frames that the monitor can display in one second. The greater the frame rate the smoother will be the experience. As a result, users may sometimes want to overclock the monitor that is they try to force the monitor to give more frame rates than the recommended frame rates which the monitor can deliver.<p/><br/><br/>
                                <h1>Does overclocking a monitor reduce lifespan?</h1>
                                <p/><br/><br/>
                                    Yes, overclocking the monitor will reduce the lifespan of the monitor. This is because the monitor is forced to provide greater frames per second than the recommended frames that it can deliver. Technically it is highly expected that overclocking monitor will usually overheat the monitor, lowering the life expectancy of the circuit board.
                                    Why Overclocking Reduce Lifespan of Monitor?
                                    <br/><br/>
                                        The overclocking of the monitors reduces the lifespan due to the following reasons:
                                        1. It will overheat the monitor. Since we are forcing the monitor to produce more frame rates, more electricity will pass through the monitor thus overheating it. Overheating always reduces the efficiency of any electronic device in the long run.
                                        2. Some monitors can show blank lines on the screen by overclocking the monitor. While some monitors which does not support too much overclocking can get permanent damages. While in the case of IPS and VA technology overclocking, the monitors will not be a big issue but with older displays, it will be a huge risk.

                                            <h1>What are Other Overclocking Monitor Risks?</h1><br/><br/>

                                                The disparity in refresh rates between 60Hz and 75Hz is the problem h. The latter is 25% faster, which may surpass the ability of the internal circuitry to synchronize the data. It's also possible that the higher frequency is overstressing the vertical sweep circuitry in CRT displays.<br/><br/><br/>
                                                    This also can lead to more CPU usage although this change is hardly noticeable. Overclocking the monitor changes the BIOS settings which sometimes may cause errors to the monitors and drivers.

                                                            The number of years that can be reduced due to the overclocking depends on several factors like what kind of usage is done, how many hours the monitor is being used? etc.
                                                            In general, the games especially AAA title games will affect the lifespan of the monitor significantly at least by 2-3 years if the average lifespan of the monitor is about 10 -15 years.

                                                                    Some of the guidelines to safely overclock are as follows:
                                                                    1. Right-click on the monitor.
                                                                    2. Select the display settings.
                                                                    3. Now scroll down to find the Advanced display settings.
                                                                    4. Now select the monitor tab.
                                                                    5. Now there will be a custom refresh rate listed.
                                                                    6. Now select the refresh rate you want. Here is the important part. We should select the refresh rate accordingly. Typically, a 60 Hz monitor can be overclocked to 75Hz but it is recommended not to go beyond this limit. Otherwise, it may affect the monitor.
                                                                    <p/><br/><br/>

However, still many of the laptops support overclocking of the monitors.

                                                                            The following is the step to overclock Intel laptop monitors:

                                                                            3. Under the details reservations settings click on the add option. Then the detailed resolution window will appear. here you can type the custom pixels and the resolution that you need.
                                                                            <br/>

                                                                                        One should not overclock the monitor more than 20-25% of the base refresh rate. For example, a 60 Hz display should be overclocked not more than 75 Hz.
                                                                                        2. By how many years will the overclocking of monitors will reduce their age?

                                                                                        3. Does overclocking the monitor give a significant jump in performance?

                                                                                    </div>
